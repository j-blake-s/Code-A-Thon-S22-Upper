# Spring 2022 Code-A-Thon Upper Division

Hello all! Welcome to the Spring 2022 Upper Division Repo. Head over to the leaderboards folder to check out the rankings for the top 3 in both 240 and 350. 

From there, you can head over to the Challenges folder to look at all the problems we had this semester. There should be a solution for each problem already made as
well as a way to generate the test cases used in the contest. Look for the sol.(py/cpp/java) in each folder which should be the working solution. Also look for a 
gen.py or mkin.py which should be the generators for the test cases.
